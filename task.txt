Tower defence

##############################
Game

We will simulate one round in simplified tower defence game. 
We have two baze classes: Enemies and Defenders. Enemies will go along the line of defenders
and each defender tries to attack every living opponent that passes next to him exactly once.   


##############################
Enemies

There is an abstract Enemy class that forms the basis of all enemies. Every enemy has:

- Name;
- Alive - information if it is alive;
- HP - the number of "health points" if it drops to zero, it dies.

There are 3 specific types of enemies:

- Giant; has no special properties
- Ogre; has an additional "armor" parameter. Every time an ogre has to lose X health points 
  it loses X-armor (but always at least 1 point).
- Rat; It has an additional "speed" parameter. With every loss
  health points, the rat panics, increasing its speed by 1.


##############################
Defenders

Each defender has a Name parameter.

There are 5 types of defenders:

- Warrior - The most basic of the defenders. He damages every enemy by amount of his "strength"
  parameter. Hes chance to miss his attack against Rat based on speed of rat. Miss chance
  formula:
  if (rng.NextDouble () <rat.speed / 100) {...}
- Archer - A subclass of the Warrior class. He only has a certain number of arrows.
  He uses 1 arrow for each attack. When he attacks a giant, he shoots him twice.
- Mage - attacks enemies by casting spells on them. It takes a certain amount of energy to
  cast a spell. When he can't cast a spell on his opponent, he regenerates energy 
  instead of attacking him.
  Has additional parameters:
  - Mana - information about the amount of magical energy he has stored;
  - SpellPower - information on how many health points it takes from the enemy, it is equal
    to amount of mana spent on casting a spell;
  - ManaRegen - information on how much energy is regenerated when unable to cast spells.
- FireMage - A wizard specializing in fire magic. His spells have an extra chance of
  killing an enemy immediately. Instant kill formula:
  if (rng.NextDouble () < killChanse) {...}
- RatCatcher - the most specialized of defenders. If he meets a rat, he catches and
  kills it and keeps its body. When he has a rat's body and meets an ogre, he throws
  that body on ogre. Ogre is terryfied and runs away (which can be simulated by killing
  an ogre immediately).
  When a ratcatcher has a rat's body, it ignores anything that is not an ogre.
